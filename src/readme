-- Lab 3 - Object-Oriented Programming --
In the native Windows File Explorer, inside the extracted ZIP file

Type "javac -d . NucleicAcid.java" to compile the NucleicAcid class file.
Type "javac -d . DNADriver.java" to compile the DNADriver class file.
Type "javac -d . DNA.java" to compile the DNA class file.
// This creates a new directory and with compiled class files for the command shell to access.
Type "java lab3.DNADriver" to execute the program.


----  Instructions for Use and Review  ----
The program will query the user for a DNA string/strand.

At the end of the prompt, the DNADriver class will send the strand to the DNA class and parse the information
and create the DNA helical structure from left to right and right to left. The DNA class will
print out the properties, highest molar mass, and total densities in both helical arrays.

Ensure that your inputs are stored and displayed properly without errors.
Ensure that the code executes without error.
